-I used as much code as I could from previous labs for example:
	-From Lab 3, using all of the shared memory code implemented from my lab solution / from the texbook
	-From Lab 2, the timing code implemented from my lab solution / from gettimeofday() to get the time it takes to perform all operations
-I wanted to make the print outs really easy to follow and make the output look generally professional which I feel i have acheived
-My comments in the code are very descriptive, I think it is important to have good documentation to make comprehension much easier
-Logical order to the way the code is presented and executed
-My collatz function which is the brain of the code is very easy to understand and reliable
-Overall I am very happy with my code and I followed theory/processes the way they were presented to me through lecture and lab exercises
