init 7 semaphores for each character

enter main
	create array of 7 semaphores one for each character
	create pid's
	debug variable (yes or no)
	character array to hold the string of 7 characters to be filtered
	setup shared memory
	save character array containing string of 7 characters into shared memory
	fork() child 1 created to handle inputes [4], [5], [6] from shared memory containg character array
		swaps the values if necessary
		fork() child 1 created to handle inputes [2], [3], [4] from shared memory containg character array
			swaps the values if necessary
				fork() child 1 created to handle inputes [0], [1], [2] from shared memory containg character array
					swaps the values if necessary
	Ensures all processes complete before program completes
exits main

enter determineOrder
	get semaphore
	assume letter
	if number, set numberFound to 1
	repeat until all number follow any letters
	release semaphore
exit determineOrder

enter swapOrder
	get semaphore
	if first element is a number and second element is a letter, swap
	if second element is a number and third element is a letter, swap
	relese semaphore
exit swapOrder

enter printDebugMode
	if debug is set to "yes"
	print all the statements associated with debug mode
exit printDebugMode
